# tictactoe-app
A fun little game I built based on the classic tic-tac-toe game to practice my Kotlin and MVVM design pattern skills. The game can be played by 2 players.

# Future plans:
- Add UI to allow the winner to enter their name and save/update the number of wins they have.
- Some UI animations and sounds to make the game more immersive.
- Add a simple AI to allow a player to play against the phone.
